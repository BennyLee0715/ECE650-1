Paper title: Edge Computing: Vision and Challenges

Motivation(s): The paper's motivation is to give their definition of edge computing, obtain the community's attention to edge computing and hopefully inspire more and further research in this field.

Contribution(s): The paper contributes to give their definition of edge computing based on their understanding, show instances of edge computing with case studies and summarize the benefits of edge computing, and list several challenges and opportunities, which are also promising research directions in this field.

Approach: Edge is defined as any computing and network resources between data sources and cloud services, while edge computing is the enabling technologies allowing computing at the edge. Computing is supposed to be put at the proximity of data sources so that response time can be improved, energy consumption can be reduced and bandwidth can be saved.

Strengths: As an overview paper, it gives a thorough introduction about edge computing, including the definition, instances where edge computing could flourish, and challenges not solved, which can help audiences even with little background have an overall understanding of edge computing. The architecture of the paper is clear and well-organized that audiences can be led into the topic step by step and layer by layer. Several case studies provide concrete examples to help audiences have a better idea of what edge computing can be in practical.

Weaknesses: The paper gives its definition of edge computing based on its understanding, however, it does not provide any other vision of definition or any comparison, which makes it difficult to judge how good or bad the definition in the paper is. The paper proposes potential solutions, e.g. computing stream for programmability and edgeOS assigning network address for naming, when talking about the challenges, but these solutions are not described and verified rigorously, which makes it unconvincing to me.
